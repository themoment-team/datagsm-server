prompt = """Create Git commits following these rules:

## Commit Message Format
- Format: `type(scope): description`
- Types: add/update/fix/refactor/test/docs/merge
- Scopes: ONLY domain names (auth, account, student, club, project, neis, client, oauth) OR module names (web, authorization, resource, userinfo) OR global. No other scopes allowed.
- Description: Korean, lowercase start, no period, avoid noun-ending style (e.g., "~ 추가", "~ 수정")
- Use subject line only (no commit body)
- Do NOT add any co-author
- Split changes into appropriate logical units with multiple commits
- Each commit should have a single responsibility

## Context

- Current git status: !{git status}
- Current git diff (staged and unstaged changes): !{git diff HEAD}
- Current branch: !{git branch --show-current}
- Recent commits: !{git log --oneline -10}

## Steps

1. Check changes with `git status` and `git diff`
2. Categorize changes into logical units (e.g., feature addition, bug fix, refactoring)
3. Group files by each unit
4. For each group:
   - Stage only relevant files with `git add`
   - Write concise commit message following conventions (subject only)
   - Execute `git commit -m "message"`
5. Verify results with `git log --oneline -n [number of commits]`

Execute the git commands to create commits based on the current changes.
