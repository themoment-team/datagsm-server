## Context

## PR Title Convention

This project uses the following PR title format: `[scope] description`

**Available Scopes:**
- **Primary**: Domain names - auth, account, student, club, project, neis, client, oauth
- **Cross-cutting concerns only**: Module names - web, authorization, resource, userinfo, common
- **Others**: ci/cd, global

**Scope Selection Rule:**
- Use domain names by default for feature-specific changes
- Only use module names or global when changes affect multiple modules or cross-cutting concerns (e.g., config, security, common utilities)

**Recent PR Title Examples:**
- `[global] 기여자 지침 문서 추가`
- `[global] 올바르지 않은 공개 API 경로 설정 수정`
- `[student] 졸업생 전환 및 저장 기능 구현`
- `[ci/cd] CD 파이프라인 ZIP 패키징 및 빌드 최적화`
- `[client] 클라이언트 조회 시 페이지네이션 파라미터 추가`

## Your task

Generate PR title suggestions and PR body following these rules:

1. **PR Title Suggestions**:
   - Suggest 3 appropriate titles based on the convention above
   - Format: `[scope] description`
   - Description: Korean, clear and concise
   - No emojis

2. **PR Body**:
   - Follow the PR template structure
   - Analyze commits and changes between develop and current branch
   - Total length must not exceed 2500 characters
   - No emojis
   - Write in Korean
   - Be clear and specific

3. **Save to file**:
   - Use the write_file tool to save the PR body to PR_BODY.md in the project root
   - File path: PR_BODY.md (relative to current directory)
   - This will overwrite the file if it already exists

4. **Output format**:

First, output the title suggestions:
